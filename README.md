Here's a repo of little coding challenges I'm doing to prepare for technical interviews and also just for fun. Here, I'm putting my solutions to little puzzles I find in various places online, like on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), [the Daily Programmer subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/), and [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), etc.
